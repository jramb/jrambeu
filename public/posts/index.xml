      <description>Travel by train I just returned from our vacation in Germany (and Prague). We traveled entirely by train, no plane nor flight. It was great!
Travel comfort: being able to just arrive at the station, minutes before departure, just enter the train, no security check, keep your luggage with you (that might be considered negative, but I like it).
